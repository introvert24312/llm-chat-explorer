[ [English](README.md) | [Italiano](README.it.md) ]

A privacy-focused web application designed to locally process and analyze exported chat data from ChatGPT by OpenAI and Claude by Anthropic. Although both models have built-in search functions, these can be slow and impractical for users managing a large number of saved conversations. With this web application, users can quickly and efficiently access their archive of AI interactions, avoiding the hassle of directly navigating raw JSON files, as is the case with Claude exports.

Additionally, the application ensures all data processing happens exclusively on the user's device, directly in the browser, maintaining privacy by preventing data transmission to external servers. Users can easily download the HTML page and inspect the source code themselves to verify functionality and security. Developed as a completely standalone project, it utilizes only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without external dependencies (except fonts), enabling immediate local deployment without additional configurations.

By leveraging their own chat backups, users can efficiently manage, consult, and revisit previous conversations. Working locally also bypasses common restrictions, such as losing access to older chats or experiencing difficulties exporting complete archives from official platforms.

## Exporting Chats from ChatGPT and Claude

To use this application, you first need to export conversations from ChatGPT or Claude. The official procedures are available at the following links:

## Introduction

**LLM Chat Explorer** is a web application that allows users to upload and analyze JSON files containing exported conversations from ChatGPT and Claude. Its intuitive interface makes it easy to search and view chats, providing a lightweight and fast solution without compromising data privacy.

One of the main advantages of this application is the ability to easily analyze AI conversations without having to decipher raw JSON files. While ChatGPT provides both a JSON file and a preformatted HTML file with all chats integrated, Claude, on the other hand, only offers a JSON file, making it particularly difficult to navigate, especially when dealing with large files. **LLM Chat Explorer** solves this problem by allowing users to seamlessly view and navigate their conversations through an intuitive and accessible interface.

## Privacy and Security

The application is designed with a strong focus on privacy:
- **Local Processing**: All data is processed directly in the browser, with no external server communication.
- **No Tracking**: Personal data and chat history remain entirely on the user’s device.
- **Source Code Inspection**: If desired, you can download the HTML page and analyze the source code.
- **Standalone**: The entire application is built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external dependencies (except for Font Awesome), specifically to allow users to download and use the HTML page locally without any additional setup.
- **Open Source**: The project is released under the GPL v3 license, ensuring transparency and allowing the community to verify and improve the code.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Internet connection required only to load the external Font Awesome CSS file (optional, for full offline use, download the corresponding CSS file).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/levysoft/llm-chat-explorer.git
    ```
2. Open the `llm-chat-explorer.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. *(Optional)* For full offline usage, simply download the Font Awesome CSS file to remove any external asset dependencies.

## Usage

1. Launch the application by opening the `llm-chat-explorer.html` file in your browser.
2. Drag and drop the JSON file (e.g., `conversations.json`) into the upload area or click to select it.
3. Browse the list of chats and select one to analyze.
4. Use the search bar to filter conversations by title or content.
5. Customize the interface by changing the language, dark mode settings, and scroll position through the settings menu.

## Application Description

The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and offers the following features:
- **Local JSON File Processing**: Data is read and processed using the `FileReader` object without being sent online.
- **Advanced Chat Management**: Supports ChatGPT and Claude’s export formats, normalizing the chat order and enabling advanced searches within titles and content.
- **Dynamic and Responsive Interface**: A sidebar for navigating chats and a display area for messages, with search and customization support.
- **Multilanguage and Dark/Light Mode**: The interface supports multiple languages (English, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Polish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) and allows enabling or disabling dark mode.
- **Chat Position**: This setting controls the order of messages within individual chats. By selecting "At end," the most recent message will appear at the bottom, similar to common messaging apps. Choosing "At start" will display the latest messages at the top.
- **Direct Chat Viewing**: Each individual chat in the backup can be accessed directly within the user's ChatGPT or Claude account by clicking the associated share link.
- **Advanced Code Block Handling**: Code blocks now feature an improved style with enhanced contrast for better readability. A "Copy" button appears on hover to easily copy code, and it is intelligently hidden for special Claude artifact messages to avoid copying irrelevant text.
